### Addition

```python
1 + 2 # result is 3
```

Addition with strings is concatenation.

```python
"Hello, " + "World!" # result is "Hello, World!"
```

### Subtraction

```python
1 - 2 # result is -1
```

### Multiplication

```python
1 * 2 # result is 2
```

Multiplication between strings and integers is string repetition.

```python
"Hello" * 3 # result is "HelloHelloHello"
```

### Division

```python
30 / 5 # result is 6
```

### Negation

```python
-1 # result is -1
!true # result is 0
```
